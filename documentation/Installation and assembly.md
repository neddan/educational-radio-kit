**Installation and Assembly**

1.	Assemble all the required components as listed in the hardware requirements.

2.	Prepare all soldering equipment (60W iron, flux and solder wire)

3.	Match and place the ICs on the PCB as labeled.

4.	Solder ICs into place 

*By this point you have an almost blank pcb with only the main IC chips. Great! we can then begin building the rest of the circuit section by section starting with the power section.*

5.	Match, place and solder the rest of the power section components as labeled. 

6.	Connect each power source one by one and verify stable output on the VCC pin using the digital multimeter. (Skip this step if not an advanced user) 

7.	Disconnect all the power sources and proceed to the next step.

8.	Match, place and solder the rest of the amplifier section components as labeled.

9.	Using the test clip provided, place the clip on the “sound test” point as labeled on the PCB. Verify you can hear a popping sound from the speaker. Even if no popping sound is heard, continue to the next step.

10.	Match, place and solder the rest of the tuning section components as labeled.

11.	Connect any power source.

12.	Connect the provided power switch and turn on the radio. 

13.	Verify static noise from the speaker.

14.	Adjust the volume Potentiometer and verify volume adjustments.

15.	Adjust the tuner and verify change in static and/or audible output on the speaker.

*If you have reached this far it means that the basic radio circuit is working and receiving power. Awesome! now we can work on setting up the power management circuit.*

16.	Connect the internal lithium-ion battery.

17.	Connect a micro-USB charger and verify that the red charging LED lights up. 

18.	For advanced users, disconnect the battery and measure the output of the power management circuit by placing the probes on +BAT and -BAT. Meter should read approximately 4.2v. Anything lower or higher than this value by more than 1 volt indicates an issue that needs to be troubleshooted. (Remember to reconnect the battery before moving on to the next step). 

19.	Connect the solar panel to the PCB and verify that the charging LED lights up. (Advanced users can repeat the voltage test as done with the micro-USB).

20.	Disconnect both solar and micro-USB if connected and connect external alkaline batteries. Verify that the charging LED does NOT light up. If charging LED lights up, that indicates an issue that needs to be troubleshooted.

21.	If all PCB component installation is completed successfully, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, please refer to the troubleshooting guide to resolve your particular issue.

22.	Place the assembled PCB in the exterior casing and fasten with screws.

23.	Fasten the speaker to the front case with screws and connect all modular components such as the battery, solar panel, speaker and antennae.

24.	Place cover on the case and fasten with screws. 

25.	Place the tunning and adjusting knobs.

26.	By this step you have successfully assembled the entire radio and can now begin using it!
