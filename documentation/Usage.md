Learn how to use the Radio Kit for transmitting and receiving signals.

**Powering On the Radio Kit**

To power on the radio kit, simply turn on the power switch.
A green indicator LED shows that the main radio is on and ready for tunning! 

The installed internal lithium-ion battery should ensure that you have multiple hours of radio playback.

Ran out of battery? Do not worry, you can connect the standard micro-USB charger to your radio kit and top-up the battery. You can even use it to directly power the radio while you still listen to your favorite radio stations.

Away from the charger or any electricity? Don’t lose hope, put your radio kit in adequate sunshine and continue your radio experience. The installed solar panel should provide enough power to charge the internal battery and power your radio playback at the same time.

In the midst of nightfall and you have no access to electricity? Your eco-friendly radio-kit has your back! Just plug in 3 single “A” batteries and resume your radio experience as you wait for sunshine or electricity to refill the internal lithium-ion battery. 

*Your radio experience is designed to be power- “filled”.*

**Tuning Frequencies**

Once the radio is on, tuning into radio stations is easy. Adjusting the “Tuner” knob changes the various radio frequencies being intercepted by the radio. You can change stations by rotating the tuner.

Volume is adjusted similarly using the volume adjuster knob.

**Transmitting and Receiving Signals**

Once set up, the radio-kit is able to intercept any FM signals from radio stations. The kit is only equipped with a receiver thus users can only tune into stations.
