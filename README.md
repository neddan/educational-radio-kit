# educational-radio-kit
This is an open source radio kit project for elementary (Primary) school education. 
The basis is to get young people familiar with basic electronics, ICs and networking in one package. 


Introduction

Welcome to the Radio Kit documentation! This documentation provides essential information on using and contributing to the Radio Kit project. The Radio Kit is designed to be an open-source radio communication platform, enabling users to build and experiment with various wireless communication applications.

Purpose of the Radio Kit

The Radio Kit is intended to serve as a learning tool and prototyping platform for radio communication. It allows users to experiment with different frequencies, communication protocols, and antenna designs. Additionally, the kit can be used in educational settings to teach the fundamentals of wireless communication, basic electronic components and circuitry as well as building a foundation for young people to prototype with advanced technology theories.

Features

Modularity: 

The radio kit is designed to be extensively modular and easy to assemble to enhance the learning process. Separate guides and fact sheets for each component are provided for the children assembling this kit.

Microcontroller:

CD2003GP (RF tunning IC). This is a common and easily accessible piece of radio silicon.

Power sources: 

The radio is powered by a combination of; 5v Solar panel, Internal 3.7v lithium-ion battery, micro-USB port and external Alkaline 1.5v batteries (x3). This ensures a continuous and uninterruptible radio listening experience no matter where the user is!

Power management:

With all the power sources in use, an automatic power management solution using affordable mobile power ICs (TP43xx family) is used to safely charge and power the radio kit without worries.
Exterior Finish:
In line with climate change adaptation and sustainable manufacturing goals, the radio kitâ€™s exterior finish is made from recycled plastic!
